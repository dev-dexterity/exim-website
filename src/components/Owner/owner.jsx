                    Hello, I'm Kaustubh Dahiwal, the founder of PRABHA EXIM NETWORK . I hold a Master's in Business Administration (MBA) and have spent the last five years working as a Sales Consultant in the automobile industry. During this time, Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience in customer relationship management, effective communication, and addressing client queries, which are essential skills in any business.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Driven by my growing interest in the import-export industry, I decided to pursue my passion by launching my own international trade venture. With a focus on building long-term relationships and delivering exceptional service, I aim to facilitate seamless global trade opportunities.
